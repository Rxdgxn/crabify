# Crabify

Decided to have a little fun with requests in Rust, so this little *saved-tracks-grabber* was born. It's not really meant for great things, since I'm just experimenting with reqwest and serde_json, but it would be nice to turn this into an app that can share the "Liked Songs" playlist (since as far as I know, there isn't actually a way to do that in Spotify).

If you want to test it out, head over to **https://developer.spotify.com/console/** and get an OAuth token for temporary use.
