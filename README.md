# Crabify

Decided to have a little fun with requests in Rust, so this little **saved-tracks-grabber** for Spotify was born. It's not really meant for great things, since I'm just experimenting with reqwest and serde_json, but it's (kinda) able to share the "Liked Songs" playlist (since as far as I know, there isn't actually a way to do that in Spotify).
Terrible implementation, I know, but it does what I wanted it to do.

If you want to test it out, head over to **https://developer.spotify.com/console/** and get an OAuth token for temporary use.
